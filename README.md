# TranslatePython
Welcome to my Readme File!
  In short, this is a Python code to which a file (be it a text file, word or other..) is transferred to the terminal and PyCharm environment and translates this file into a language acceptable to the user.
The "pip install translate" module is used in the project, with the help of which the functionality of the code is executed. This is also the address of the person whose module I used
-> https://pypi.org/project/translate and this is also the documentation -> https://translate-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.

  I have also used "List of ISO 639-1 codes" which means ISO 639 is a standardized nomenclature used to classify languages. Each language is assigned a two-letter
(639-1) and three-letter (639-2 and 639-3) lowercase abbreviation, amended in later versions of the nomenclature.
This table lists all of:
ISO 639-1: two-letter codes, one per language for ISO 639 macrolanguage. link here -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes

* I have also used "argparse" module which used To add an option to run this code at the terminal, you can use the argparse module, which allows you to specify command-line arguments and options.

* To run the code from any terminal you need to set "pip install translate" And in this form run the code $ python main.py (here gose file name for example) test.txt (here gose language for example) ka

example down below:
* $ python main.py test.txt ka
